<h4>Use Case 3: Merchant lending basis flow data (UPI/GSTN)</h4><article>
 <div class="content-desc">



Description: Currently merchants are assessed for their creditworthiness based on their bank statements, P&L statements and transactions done over a period of time. Banks want to explore UPI and GSTN (GST Network) to assess the creditworthiness based on the transactions made on the UPI and GST Network. We seek solutions to develop the analytical models with UPI and GSTN data of merchants to gauge their creditworthiness.</div></article>



<h4>Use Case 4: Integrated billing at Merchant</h4> <article>
 <div class="content-desc">

<h4>Use Case 5: Risk & Fraud Management solution for UPI system</h4><article>
 <div class="content-desc">



Description: Banking industry is looking forward to apply security checks in real time on each UPI transaction. The system should be able to identify in real time if the transaction hitting the bank doesn't fit into a customer's normal transaction pattern. This system analyzes transaction data across all channels to develop patterns and match the conducted transaction with these patterns in real time for validity. There is a possibility that customer is actually transacting with parameters outside of earlier pattern, so the system should be capable to allow the transaction but with one more level of authentication from the customer.</div></article>



<h4>Use Case 6: Tap and Go payment- Low cost Contactless payment solution for smart/non-smart phones</h4><article>
 <div class="content-desc">

Thus it had not been used as a quick tap and go payment mode like in public transport - metro and buses - where the processing time has to be very less. The need is for a quick tap and go payment mode using smartphones (without NFC) which takes very less time for conducting the transaction.</div></article>



<h4>Use Case 7: Internet of things for tracking agricultural assets</h4><article>
 <div class="content-desc">



Description: India is yet to see wide adoption of IoT based solutions in agriculture. The IoT based solutions (e.g. tracking assets, survey drones, tracking weather / Crop conditions) can track an abundance of insightful data for farmers. Data analytics tools can help interpret this data into actionable intelligence for the bank through which bank can provide better loan support and financial services to the farmers. Bank wants to assist their rural customers to adopt precision farming practices and build better relationships with the customers.

This will help the bank to align our communication channels to the masses and gauge effectiveness of a particular channel w.r.t. negative/positive PR and brand perception of the bank. </li> </ul></div></article>



<h4>Use Case 11: Omni Channel Customer Servicing </h4><article>
 <div class="content-desc">



Description: Universal chat platform for end customer engagement and servicing.<ul>
<li>Challenge: Different customers have different preferences for engagement and communication. Broken link between the CRM and outbound customer interactions/ communications leads to diluted customer experience and satisfaction score.  </li>
<li>Solution: An engine/chatbot that shd be able to chat to customer to his/her  preferred channels like e-mail, facebook messenger, whatsapp along with history of their earlier communications.</li> </ul></div></article>



<h4>Use Case 12: Real time survey for Property related underwriting and claim</h4><article>
 <div class="content-desc">



Description: Accepting risk for property insurance and settling claims for property insurance requires inspection of the property and surroundings. Personal presence may not be possible in some cases or in some referred risks (typically high risk, high value). We need a solution that will allow personnel to survey the risk location, property and surroundings without physical presence.</div></article>



<h4>Use Case 13: Low cost accident detection IoT device</h4> <article>
 <div class="content-desc">


Description: Seeking an ultra-low cost (less than 5$) accident detection IoT device which can just give an alert whenever a vehicle meets an accident. 
<ul>
<li>Cat 1: Major crashes </li>
<li>Cat 2: Frontal / Back impact</li>
<li>Cat 3: Small dents that can spoil the look</li>
<li>Cat 4: Scratches or small grazes one can ignore</li> 
</ul>

It should be able to detect at least Cat 1 and 2 accidents and preferably Cat 3 as well.  However, at the same time it shouldn’t result in false positives. For e.g. in case of jerks and jolts due to bad road conditions. The focus of the problem statement is to accurately determine an accident event on the Indian road conditions where average speed is not high and thus just the “g” value threshold would not give accurate results.  You can also consider leveraging some of the functionalities (such as GPRS, GPS) from driver’s mobile phone rather than building it in the device. The device can be battery powered (Preferred) with 1 year battery life or can derive power from vehicle itself if that improves the accuracy.</div></article>



<h4>Use Case 14: Tapping digital information sources in lieu of physical documents (or scans etc.) for customer origination & assessment</h4> <article>
 <div class="content-desc">



Description: Paper application forms and documents are common across financial institutions. A handful of electronic solutions exist, but at a high cost and do not cater to original documents. Financial institutions also use several electronic portals for information collection but are governed by unique processes, tokens and passwords.</div></article>



<h4>Use Case 15: Promote financial literacy through gamification</h4> <article>
 <div class="content-desc">


Description: Promoting financial literacy is a common goal of the government as well as financial institutions. However, this is proving to be a challenge due to the vast diversity of our indigenous populace. In the modern era, mobile games are highly popular and have been used for effectively promoting various products. They are even used as training tools by organizations. Channelizing games as a means to help people learn about various products such as loans, investments, etc. in an interesting and engaging manner would be highly beneficial.</div></article>



<h4>Use Case 16: Credit Underwriting</h4> <article>
 <div class="content-desc">



Description: Existing credit underwriting models do not leverage new sources of qualitative and quantitative information, both for individuals and small-and-medium enterprises ("SMEs"). A more refined method based on relevant parameters that could be correctly captured and analyzed would result in a significant increase in accuracy.</div></article>



<h4>Use Case 17: Digital Signatures</h4><article>
<div class="content-desc">



Description: Digital signatures are being accepted in businesses and financial institutions, though their validity in the legal court of law is yet to be determined. We look forward to innovative solutions in this space which can authenticate the content and sender information with low cost and universal applicability. The solution should be able to identify key person/ signing authorities/ customer details plus post sanction documentation execution with them. This will include Digital acceptance and signing of agreements. The customer here can be an individual, multiple partners or a partnership concern, directors of a Pvt. ltd company. </div></article>



<h4>Use Case 18: End-to-end Assessment of a SME</h4> <article>
 <div class="content-desc">



Description: There are solutions available to financial institutions for assessing the SMEs on different parameters like Bank Statement, Social presence, location of business etc. But there is no single solution which assesses the SMEs exhaustively through all such information sources. We look forward to solutions which can provide holistic reports on assessment based on all the information sources.</div></article>



<h4>Use Case 19: Digital Marketing solution</h4> <article>
 <div class="content-desc">



Description: Digital marketing is an imperative focus area for all financial firms. We seek solutions around digital marketing which manages the complete lifecycle of communication including internet, emails, phone calls etc. It should also be able to manage marketing databases to increase CTR and run the campaigns effectively.
